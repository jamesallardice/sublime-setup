## My settings for Sublime Text 2

This repository contains a bunch of configuration files for Sublime Text 2 and
various packages. It exists to make it easy for me to set up a new installation
of Sublime Text 2.

It should work with Sublime Text 3, but some of the packages I use regularly do
not yet.

**This is written for use on OS X. It won't work on Windows, or any other OS.**

## Setup

Simply clone the repository and run the setup script from within the directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jamesallardice/sublime-setup && cd sublime-setup
./setup.sh
```
